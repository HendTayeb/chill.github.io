Pixel-art web page displaying music playlist using HTML, CSS, and javascript. It's my first time creating a website from scratch and only code. For self-education and for the sake of doing something fun!

Note: currently, the page works fine (not great) for Mac users but not very well for Windows/Linux users. Therefore, refinements will be done.

The music list used:
eery - her<br>
bunko stew - hide the pain<br>
elijah - sad and bonjou<br>
saib. - in your arms<br>
nohidea - thirteen<br>
atlas - sand<br>
potsu - Im closing my eyes<br>
eery - off-white<br>
